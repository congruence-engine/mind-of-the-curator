# Mind of the Curator 


## Short summary
This investigation aims to develop understanding of how past curatorial practice inflects the data that the Science Museum holds on its objects. An investigation with both archival research and digital components, taking the example of the Science Museum’s 1921 published catalogue of its textile machinery collection. We explored the nature of the – highly technical – language, using Surprisingly Frequent Phrase Detection and KeyBERT techniques to analyse and visualise this (via Voyant Tools). We contextualised this via new archival research into the curatorial working culture of the interwar Science Museum and via a comparison with the 1970s+ practice of the Bradford Industrial Museum. We hypothesised a way to understand the language via Ludwick Fleck’s notion of ‘thought collective’.The investigation provided strong empirical evidence for understanding why our collections-related data takes the form it does. It also led to the Wikidata Taxonomy project (qv). A chapter in Emergent Histories describes the investigation. 


## Research Questions 

1.	How does past curatorial practice inflect the data that the Science Museum holds on its objects; how can we anchor that in the history of the Museum, and by what conceptual means can we visualise and understand that practice?
  
2.	How can we use digital tools, including RegEx, OpenRefine, Surprisingly Frequent Phrase Detection and KeyBERT to reveal the characteristics of the language? 
  
3.	Do later established museums share the same styles of descriptive language?
